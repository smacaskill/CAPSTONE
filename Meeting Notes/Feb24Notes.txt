Slides should have meaning, answer the business problem and the business solution and any innovation we used. Condense information slides (team information, project information)

Put together client letter for iteration 1.

Add 2 use case descriptions to project plan for iteration 2. 

Define deliverables for Iteration 2 (Pages that will be complete i.e. product page, store page, store inventory report page, possibly product report with stores available stock)

Project Plan essentially functions as a Agile backlog as long as we are updating project plan with specific tasks for each iteration.
